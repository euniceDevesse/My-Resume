<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eunice, I'm a Computer Science student.I started this
  web Development bootcamp because I want to have more 
  technical skills and apply the knowledge I have to build 
  projects. I'm very fascinated about creating and designing webpages because 
  the main purpose to create an application or a system is to help solving problems we as humans face. 
  Most of the times, people struggle when using these applications and the cause of it is 
  an inconsistent design. I believe every develop should provide a good experience of their applications or 
  websites to their clients and my goal is to one day have my own brand and 
  create my own website that will help me manage my future business and also 
  to help other entrepreneurs to generate more profit, transforming 
  their business into digital ones.

<p>Part of what I like 
  includes dancing, going on thrills, singing, readind, writing poems and stories, coooking and playing instruments like 
  the piano and the guitar.
